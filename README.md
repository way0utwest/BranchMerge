# BranchMerge
This repo demonstrattes some work with branching and merging. The general structure is as follows:

- dev : all work is done here or in feature branches merged to dev
- qa : all work here is merged from the dev branch, maybe through a feature branch, maybe no.
- main : all work here is merged from qa, again with or without a feature branch
